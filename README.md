# ZeroHour

- 📄 **Git Workflow:** [GIT_WORKFLOW.md](./GIT_WORKFLOW.md)
- 📄 **Execution Plan:** [EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./EXECUTION_PLAN.md)
- 📄 **How it works (detail):** [docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md](./docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md)

ZeroHour is a terminal-native CLI that identifies **what breaks the business first** in a codebase.

It is **not a SAST replacement**.  
It is the **decision layer before SAST**.

---

## Problem

Modern SAST tools are powerful, but they:
- Produce hundreds of findings
- Lack business context
- Do not help teams decide what to fix *today*

Teams know *what is wrong*, but not *what hurts first*.

---

## What ZeroHour Does

ZeroHour analyzes a codebase and outputs:

- **Only the top 3 issues**
- Ranked by **failure impact**
- Translated into **business consequences**

It answers:
> “What breaks first if this fails?”

---

## Core Principles

- **Failure-first, not vulnerability-first**
- **Forced prioritization (Top 3 only)**
- **Business context built-in**
- **Explainable results**
  - Why this matters
  - How it fails
  - How to fix it
- **No ML guessing**
  - Deterministic and auditable
- **Terminal-native**
  - No dashboards
  - No setup

---

## How It Fits With SAST

SAST tools are important. ZeroHour does not replace them.

**SAST**
- Finds what is wrong

**ZeroHour**
- Decides what matters first

ZeroHour runs **before** SAST triage to focus effort where impact is highest.

## Usage

From the project root after `npm run build`:

```bash
# Run zerohour analyze separately (recommended)
./zerohour analyze

# Analyze current directory
./zerohour analyze

# Analyze a specific directory
./zerohour analyze -C examples/sample-app

# Plain text output (no boxen)
./zerohour analyze --no-box
```

Use `zerohour` from any directory by adding the project to your PATH (optional):

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/zerohour:$PATH"
zerohour analyze
zerohour analyze -C /path/to/your/app
```

Other options:

```bash
npm run analyze                    # same as ./zerohour analyze
npm run analyze -- -C examples/sample-app
npx zerohour analyze               # if npx is available
npm link && zerohour analyze       # global install (may need sudo for link)
```
