# RiskBoard

## Track
Cybersecurity & Threat Intelligence

## Problem Statement
Modern security teams face extreme alert overload. Thousands of vulnerabilities,
alerts, and threat indicators are generated daily, but most lack the necessary
context to determine real business impact.

Security alerts are typically evaluated in isolation, without considering:
- The business criticality of affected assets
- Real-world exploitability of threats
- Operational and organizational impact

This leads to alert fatigue, inefficient resource usage, and delayed response to
critical risks.

---

## Solution Overview
RiskBoard is a **context-aware threat prioritization platform** that helps security
teams focus on what truly matters.

Instead of treating all alerts equally, RiskBoard correlates security threats with
organizational context and business importance to produce a ranked list of
**“Top Risks Right Now.”**

The goal is simple:  
**Show security teams exactly what to fix first and why.**
