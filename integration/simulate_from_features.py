"""
Simulation runner that connects feature extraction output
to the Trace Engine.

This script:
- Loads extracted_features.json (produced by notebooks)
- Feeds feature events to the Rule Engine
- Generates decision traces

This is intentionally event-based (not streaming)
for demo clarity and inspectability.
