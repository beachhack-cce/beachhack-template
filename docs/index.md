# ZeroHour Documentation Index

This index is the **single navigation entry point** for all ZeroHour documentation.
It is organized by **intent**, not by file type, to reduce repetition and reading time.

---

## Start Here (Concept + Context)

Read these first if you are new to ZeroHour or reviewing the project:

1. **Overview** — what ZeroHour is, what problem it solves, and how it works at a high level  
   [overview.md](./overview.md "Project overview, idea, and positioning")

2. **FAQ** — clarifies scope, AI usage, Semgrep’s role, and common misunderstandings  
   [faq.md](./faq.md "Frequently asked questions")

---

## Getting Started (Hands-on)

Use these when you want to run ZeroHour:

- ⚙️ **Installation** — setup, build, and verification  
  [installation.md](./installation.md "Installation guide")

- ▶️ **Usage** — CLI commands, output limits, experimental flags, SDK hints  
  [usage.md](./usage.md "CLI usage guide")

---

## How ZeroHour Works (Technical Core)

Read these to understand **the system design and reasoning model**.
These files are complementary and non-duplicative.

- 🧱 **Architecture** — end-to-end pipeline (Semgrep → Grok → AI → CLI/SDK)  
  [architecture.md](./architecture.md "System architecture and data flow")

- 🧠 **Analysis Logic** — how findings are interpreted, prioritized, and explained  
  [analysis_logic.md](./analysis_logic.md "Failure-impact decision logic")

- ⚠️ **Limitations** — explicit technical and conceptual constraints  
  [limitations.md](./limitations.md "Known and intentional limitations")

---

## Reference (Lookup, Not Narrative)

Use these as reference material, not sequential reading:

- 📖 **Glossary** — definitions of ZeroHour-specific terms (Semgrep, Grok, SDK, etc.)  
  [glossary.md](./glossary.md "Terminology reference")

---

## Project & Development

Read these if you are contributing, reviewing architecture decisions, or tracking progress:

- 🧭 **Execution Plan** — current development plan aligned with the latest architecture  
  [execution_plan.md](./execution_plan.md "Execution and build plan")

- 🗺️ **Roadmap** — current scope, near-term goals, and uncommitted ideas  
  [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md "Project roadmap")

- 🔀 **Git Workflow** — branching, commits, PRs, and recovery rules  
  [git_workflow.md](./git_workflow.md "Git workflow and contribution process")

- 🧑‍💻 **Contributing** — contribution rules and constraints  
  [contributing.md](./contributing.md "Contribution guidelines")

---

## Archived Documents

Outdated documents kept **only for historical reference**.
Do not use these as a source of truth.

- 🗄️ **Execution Plan (V1)**  
  [archive/execution_plan-V1.md](./archive/execution_plan-V1.md "Archived execution plan")
